		<h1>About Dottask</h1>
		<p>Dottask is a tool for quickly making directed graphs. I originally created it for personal use and so that I could try learning Reagent and Clojurescript. While it's still more of a pet project than a mature tool, I've already personally found it to be quite useful and fun. Please feel free to <a href="./index.html">give it a try</a> and tell me what you think on <a href="https://twitter.com/mattboehm">Twitter</a>/GitHub.</p>
		<h2>Why I am making Dottask</h2>
		<p>I love to use graphs to help plan a new project or communicate concepts to others. They let me think visually and spatially about problems, while remaning structural enough to keep me focused on my goals.</p>
		<p>Graphviz is my favorite tool for making graphs. I can create the nodes and edges via text entry or programmatically, and it automatically generates pretty great layouts. Thanks to viz.js, there are multiple web-based graphviz IDE's that let you instantly see graphs alongside their textual definition. However, having to edit this textual representation to change the graph can get a bit cumbersome, and I suspect that this is one of the reasons that more people don't use this fantastic tool.</p>
		<p>When I needed to brainstorm or plan, I'd often catch myself drawing graphs on pencil and paper instead of my beloved Graphviz. Sure, this meant that I needed to lay things out myself and frequently reach for an eraser to make edits. However, not having to deal with the textual representation was still a huge reduction in cognitive overhead and completely changed how I thought.</p>
		<p>Having seen the pros and cons of both of these approaches to graph-making, I wanted to make a tool that gave me the best of both worlds. Dottask uses Graphviz internally to provide the same great automated layout. However, instead of editing a text file, it lets you use a mouse, a touchscreen or vim-inspired keyboard shortcuts to work much more quickly. </p>
